  summary: Reset password
  description: |-
    Generate and email a temporary one time password that can be used to login. (see /v1/account/login for more information).

    **Will this disable my current password?**

    No, it will only offer an alternative way to login. If you suspect that someone is trying to access your account, consider changing your password to a longer and more secure one.

    **Security**

    The one time password will only be active for a limited time, then revoked. Accounts can only be reset once per week. Response messages will not do any attempt to validate input email addresses. This to prevent account leaks.
