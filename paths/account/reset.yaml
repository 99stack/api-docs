  summary: Reset
  description: |-
    Generate and email a temporary one time password that can be used to login. (see /v1/account/login for more information).

    **Will this disable my current password?**

    No, it will only offer an alternative way to login. If you suspect that someone is trying to access your account, consider changing your password to a longer and more secure one.

    **Security**
    Please keep in mind that this function will respond with a 202 success message instead of a 404 message in the event that no account matches the provided email address. This is a feature with the primary purpose to protect against robots seeking to harvest personal data.
