  summary: Availibility
  description: "Returns the availability in percent for each server generation. A value of 0.00 means sold out, anything above 0.00 up to 1.00 means that there are servers in stock. The higher value, the more servers in stock. Use this in case you're planning to deploy a large amount of servers (+100) and don't want your request to fail because we're out of stock for the specific generation you'd choosed."
