  summary: Remove floating IP
  description: |-
    This function allows you to remove a floating IP address. However, it's important to note that the IP address must first be detached from any server, or the function will return an error. 
    
    Additionally, please be aware that in some regions, the removal of floating IPs may be restricted until a certain amount of time has elapsed, typically around 24 hours. This precaution is in place to ensure proper handling of IP addresses.
