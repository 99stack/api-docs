  summary: Remove VPC
  description: |-
    This function allows you to remove a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). However, it's important to note that the VPC must first be detached from any servers, or the function will return an error. 
    
    Additionally, please be aware that in some regions, the removal of VPCs may be restricted until a certain amount of time has elapsed, typically around 24 hours. This precaution is in place to ensure proper handling of network resources.
